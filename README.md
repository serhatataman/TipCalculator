# Tip Calculator Android Application

Tip Calculator is an app to practice the basic concepts of application development on Android.

## Layout
+ The user will be able to enter a bill amount
+ When the user enters the bill amount the application calculates the final bill amount and displays the calculations.
+ The application contains 3 buttons to change the tip percentage to 10%, 15% and 20%.
+ The code adheres to all of the following best practices:
  + Text sizes are defined in sp
  + Lengths are defined in dp
  + Padding and margin is used appropriately, so that the views are not crammed up against each other.

## Functionality
+ The code runs without errors.
+ Each percentage button updates the TextViews by adding the correct new values.
+ The reset button resets the scores on both of the score TextViews.

## Code Readability
+ Any classes are named after the object they represent. All variables are named by their intended contents. All methods are named by their intended effect or in the style required by a callback interface.
+ "There are no unnecessary blank lines. One variable is declared per declaration line. The code within a method is indented with respect to the method declaration line."

The following additional features are implemented:

+ All the values for dimensions are specified in dimens.xml
+ All the string values are specified in strings.xml
